      description:
        full: "The Meta Llama 3.1 collection, released by Meta on July 23, 2024, is\
          \ a set of multilingual large language models available in 8B, 70B, and\
          \ 405B parameter sizes. The models are offered in both pretrained and instruction-tuned\
          \ versions, with the latter being optimized for dialogue use cases. Built\
          \ on an auto-regressive transformer architecture with Grouped-Query Attention\
          \ (GQA), the tuned models are refined using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\
          \ and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Llama 3.1 is intended\
          \ for commercial and research applications. The instruction-tuned models\
          \ are designed for assistant-like chat, while the pretrained models can\
          \ be adapted for various natural language generation tasks. The custom commercial\
          \ license also allows for using the model's output for synthetic data generation\
          \ and distillation to improve other models."
